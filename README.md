Build Data Dashboards:
In this project, we’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. We’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more.

Interprete a data visualisation:
In this project, we’ll explore an interactive data dashboard to uncover insights. We’ll write a short report explaining each insight, and how we found the information to reach our conclusion from the dashboard.

Query a Digital Music Store Database:
In this project, we will query a digital music store database which holds information regarding the store’s media, employees, and customers. We will use the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.

Survey project:
Learn how to use statistics and visuals to find and communicate insights. Develop Excel skills to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data in a spreadsheet. Build Excel models to analyze possible business outcomes.
